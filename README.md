- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @R2DDOS
- ğŸ‘€ I am interested in learning more about c++ and python
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ...
- ğŸ˜„ Everyone calls me Arturo but I like R2DDOS
- âš¡ A curious fact is that I've almost finished my degree and I'm just getting interested in programming and at the moment it hasn't become very difficult, just a little repetitive, I hope I don't regret what I put in haha
